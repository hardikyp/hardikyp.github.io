        <p>I am honored to share that I have been selected for the 2025 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. The fellowship provides three years of support that will allow our lab to accelerate work on deployable bridge systems and their field deployment.</p>
        <p>We will dedicate the first year to building a larger scale prototype with the Smart Structures Lab, instrumenting it with a new sensing suite, and conducting validation experiments outdoors. If you are curious about the instrumentation plan or would like to collaborate, please reach out.</p>
